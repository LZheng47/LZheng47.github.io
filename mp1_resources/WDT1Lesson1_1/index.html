    <!-- Challenge 1: Change the title of the page to Web Technologies -->
    <title>Web Technologies</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>
      HTML is Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language used to create webpages. HTML designs the structure of the webpage, laying out where to display elements of a webpage, including paragraphs, subtitles, headings, pictures, and etc. This language also formats the general way of how texts are displayed, such as if they are bolded, the spacing between the texts, and etc.

    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS.  At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>
      CSS is Cascading Style Sheets, a language that helps modify the style of HTML elements. They can be used to specify colors and fonts of text. CSS files can be reused, which means they guarantee efficiency, allowing for different HTML webpages to use the same style.

    <!-- Challenge Bonus: Similar to the concepts above add one more web technology using a heading and paragraph.  Here are some suggestions of concepts: JQuery, Bootstrap, AFrame -->
    <h3>jQuery</h3>
    <p>
      jQuery is a JavaScript library and also an open-source software, implemented by referencing it in the head section of the HTML file. jQuery is compatable with many different web browsers, making it easier for web designers to code rather than modifying it specifically for each. jQuery lets information on webpage update without the need to refresh or move different elements on a page.

    <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
    <p>
      Bootstrapping describes a process that automatically executes a series of commands. An example of this is the startup to a computer, since when it is turned on, the computer automatically runs commands that powers on the hardware, loads the UEFI firmware, and other processes are initialized. Bootstrap can also be used to decribe applications when they are opened, iniating commands that may check for updates or load certain libraries.
